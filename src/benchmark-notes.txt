simple-vector: dswp returns 0 because the return task does not have z as a dependecy so it runs immediately.
2d-array: seems to work inconsistently. Unsure why.
vote-run: works properly
commset: works properly
multi-blocks: works properly (after the change to scheduler init_jobs join_all)


after removing waiting on eop

simple-vector: seems to work
2d-array: does not work (as expected as we are missing a dependency)
vote-run: seems to work
commset: seems to work
multi-blocks: seems to work most times. Got this once: An error occurred: Invalid_argument("index out of bounds")
